        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>J.E.B. Motors was founded by John Balci, a visionary who transformed his high school "LSV" passion project into a company, with the goal of continuing what he worked on as well as advancing the foundations he had already built.</p>

                <h3>Autonomous LSV</h3>
                <p>The Autonomous LSV is a fully-electric vehicle aiming to achieve a low-speed delegation, such that it may be federally regulated to drive on highways where the speed limit does not exceed 35 mph.</p>
                <p>The goal of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of the design process, prepare for bigger steps, and to create a cheaper car for those who are uninterested in traversing the dangerous American highway.</p>
